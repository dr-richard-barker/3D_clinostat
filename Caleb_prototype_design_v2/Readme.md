SLDPRT stands for SolidWorks Part File. 
It is a CAD file format used by SolidWorks software to store 3D part models. 
SLDPRT files are a complex, proprietary format that uses the Microsoft Structured Storage file format to store. 
SLDPRT files are used to design and view specific parts of an overall system. 
They contain source data for the solid geometry to allow easy editing of the model within Solidworks. 
SLDPRT files can be opened using SmartCAM CAD/CAM Software by SolidWorks. 
Multiple SLDPRT files having compatible parts can be combined to create a single SLDASM assembly file.

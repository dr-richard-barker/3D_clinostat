## Insight Wisconsin 3D Clinostat

### Overview

This documentation provides information on the SolidWorks Part Files (.SLDPRT) associated with the Insight Wisconsin 3D clinostat project. SLDPRT files are utilized by SolidWorks CAD software for storing detailed 3D models of individual parts. These files embody a proprietary format that leverages the Microsoft Structured Storage framework to encapsulate solid geometry data for parts. This data is essential for creating, editing, and visualizing components of the clinostat in SolidWorks.

### SLDPRT Files

SLDPRT files contain the geometric information of parts, enabling their precise design and modification within the SolidWorks environment. These files are critical for developing individual components of larger assemblies, such as the Insight Wisconsin 3D clinostat.

### Compatibility and Assembly

SLDPRT files designed with compatibility in mind can be seamlessly integrated to form a comprehensive SLDASM (assembly file). This assembly process brings together compatible parts, as designed and stored in individual SLDPRT files, into a single cohesive model - in this instance, the entire 3D clinostat model.

### Opening SLDPRT Files

To view or modify SLDPRT files, you can use SolidWorks or compatible CAD/CAM software such as SmartCAM. These tools offer the ability to open, edit, and work with the detailed design data embedded within the files.

### Conclusion

The .SLDPRT files associated with the Insight Wisconsin 3D clinostat offer a detailed look into the design and components of the clinostat. Through proper use of SolidWorks or compatible software, these files serve as the foundation for assembling and editing the 3D clinostat model, facilitating its design, visualization, and further modification as needed.
